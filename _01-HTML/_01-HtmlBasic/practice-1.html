    <h1>This is a climate articale</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Extreme weather and climate events, such as heat waves, cyclones, and
      floods, are an expression of climate variability. These events and events
      influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause
      significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental
      health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events
      declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving
      into harm’s way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth’s
      energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme
      events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to
      accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of
      these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could
      be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with
      improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting
      vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system
      adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce
      risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure.
      The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.

    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      Worldwide, in 2019, there were 396 disasters1 that killed 11,755 people,
      affected 95 million others, and cost nearly US$130 billion (28). Asia was
      the most affected continent with 40% of the events, 45% of the deaths, and
      74% of all people affected. Floods and storms accounted for 68% of the
      number of affected people worldwide. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG)
      emissions, land use change, and other activities impacting the global
      energy balance are altering the frequency and intensity of many extreme
      weather and climate events, with some regions experiencing increases in
      heat waves, floods, and droughts (84). Events influenced by climate
      change, particularly wildfires, also are increasing. Risks from extreme
      weather and climate events arise from the intersection of the physical
      hazard (e.g., wind and rain), the extent of exposure to the hazard, the
      vulnerability of individuals and communities, and the capacity to prepare
      for, manage, and recover from extreme events. A disaster generally is
      defined as a sudden, calamitous event that disrupts the functioning of a
      community or society and that exceeds its ability to cope using its own
      resources (81). The occurrence of an extreme event is not required for a
      community or region to experience extreme impacts, such as large increase
      in mortality; an extreme impact can arise from a moderately strong event
      when it occurs in a highly vulnerable population. The converse also is
      true, that an extreme event may not result in extreme impacts when
      communities are prepared. Roughly 20% of disasters in 2019 occurred in
      North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, for total
      damages of US$55 billion, of which US$29 billion were insured (130). Loss
      events included Hurricane Dorian, which caused billions of dollars in
      damage, especially in the Bahamas, in late August to early September.
      Heavy losses that year also resulted from severe weather, floods, and a
      winter storm in the United States. A mixture of snowmelt triggered by
      unusually high temperatures in March and storms with torrential rain led
      to sustained and extensive flooding in Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and
      Mississippi (49). Overall, the numbers and costs of disasters have been
      increasing for several decades due to increases in exposure (more people
      moving into harm’s way and increases in the values of property and
      infrastructure at risk), vulnerability of people and infrastructure, and
      climate change (170). Since 1980, the United States has experienced 265
      weather and climate disasters in which the overall damages reached or
      exceeded US$1 billion; the total costs were greater than US$1.775 trillion
      (132), with an estimated 14,223 deaths (an average of 356 per year),
      although the numbers of deaths are likely an underestimate (178). Beyond
      the damage to infrastructure, extreme weather events and disasters can
      affect the health and well-being of individuals and can have catastrophic
      impacts on communities and health systems. People can suffer from a wide
      range of physical effects (e.g., heat exhaustion, injuries in severe
      storms, and respiratory illnesses from molds due to floods) as well as
      longer-term impacts on mental health. Health systems and facilities can be
      affected by impacts on patients and health care staff, medical and
      nonmedical supplies, facility operations, and critical infrastructures. To
      prepare for climate change, health-sector and emergency-management
      officials—as well as urban planners, neighborhood services staff, and
      others—require information about how hazards are projected to change,
      possible future exposures of people and property, likely changes in
      population health and health care infrastructure vulnerabilities, and
      needed capacities to prepare for and manage the events and their
      aftermath. We review (a) the current impacts and projected risks of
      climate change on the health of populations and health systems from
      extreme weather and climate events and from wildfires, (b) the value of
      disaster management to reduce health risks from these changes, and (c)
      adaptation and mitigation measures that can explicitly address climate
      change in policies and planning processes.

    <h2>2. EXTREME EVENTS INFLUENCED BY CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
    <p>
      Global land surface air temperature has risen 1.53°C since the
      preindustrial period of 1850–1900, with considerable variation in regional
      warming; this increase is much larger than the observed warming combined
      over land and oceans (0.87°C) (84). Climate models project robust
      differences in regional climate characteristics, including extremes.
      Detection and attribution analytic methods are increasingly being applied
      to determine the effects of climate change on the frequency and/or
      magnitude of extreme events. For example, in mid-September 2019,
      torrential rainfall from Tropical Storm Imelda caused large-scale flooding
      in Southeast Texas, affecting an estimated 6.6 million people and
      resulting in rescues of over 1,000 people and 5 deaths (171). The recorded
      precipitation at the station with the highest total amount of rainfall
      from this event would be expected only approximately once every 1,200
      years. The 2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report
      on Climate Change and Land (84) concluded that warming since the period
      1850–1900 has resulted in an increased frequency, intensity, and duration
      of extreme events in most land regions, including the following
      observations:
    </p>

    <h3>2.1. Tropical Cyclones or Hurricanes</h3>

    Tropical cyclones (TCs) that make landfall are among the most dramatic and
    costly disasters. They have different names depending on the basin where
    they occur (hurricanes in the northern Atlantic and northeastern Pacific,
    typhoons in the northwestern Pacific, and cyclones in the southern Pacific
    or Indian Ocean) but are the same meteorological phenomena. They cause
    strong winds and flooding from intense rainfall and a surge of ocean water
    that causes dramatic damage to buildings and infrastructure along
    coastlines, often including widespread utility outages. TCs have cost the
    United States close to US$1 trillion since 1980 (157). Low- and
    middle-income countries (LMICs) have suffered smaller total economic losses,
    but the losses are often a larger proportion of their nations’ economies and
    arguably have greater consequences for well-being (67). Alongside physical
    damages, TCs are highly detrimental to human health (107). From 1963 to
    2012, there were 2,544 deaths in the United States (~50 per year) directly
    caused by the forces of TCs (e.g., drowning in floods caused by storm surge
    or extreme rainfall, or physical trauma caused by windborne debris) (142). A
    comparable number of TC-related deaths are indirectly caused in individuals
    with preexisting conditions exacerbated by the stress or strain of a storm.
    Hurricane Katrina alone caused 520 direct deaths and 565 indirect deaths
    (143). Accounts of individual TCs clearly indicate upticks in a variety of
    other health problems that do not necessarily result in death, including
    injuries, diseases, skin infections, and mental health impacts (e.g., 43,
    73, 87, 141). New data sets of TC exposure history are increasing
    possibilities for robust, long-term epidemiological studies of these diverse
    health impacts from TCs (e.g., preterm birth; see 161) that will enhance our
    ability to predict and prepare for future TC health impacts. A confounding
    challenge in projecting future TC impacts is the relatively low confidence
    in projections of TC changes with climate change. Projections suggest the
    most intense TCs will likely increase in frequency and exhibit higher
    precipitation rates; however, there is uncertainty whether the overall
    number of TCs may increase or decrease, with different trends projected
    depending on the modeling approach (46, 103, 154). However, other trends are
    clearly heightening TC risks to individuals and communities. Exposure to TCs
    is increasing as people move to and settle along coastlines (57), and
    potential damages from storm surge are increasing with sea-level rise (113).

    <h3>2.2. Compound Events</h3>
    <p>
      Complicating projections of extreme-event impacts is the fact that many
      disasters are the result of combinations of extremes (sometimes called
      compound, interacting, interconnected, or cascading events) (140, 154).
      Compound extreme events consist of two or more events interacting across
      time and/or space, such as back-to-back extreme heat events or an extreme
      heat event coincident with a drought (184). The range of compound extremes
      that might endanger human health is large. The study of compound extremes
      is a nascent and rapidly evolving research area. In many cases,
      understanding of present and projected risks of a particular compound
      extreme event is lacking, including key societal drivers of vulnerability
      (144). We highlight a few types of compound climatic extreme events. Heat
      waves are exacerbated when combined with other extreme events. Heat waves
      can enhance buildup of ozone and other pollutants, leading to combinations
      of heat and air pollution dangerous for human health (4, 111). A
      particularly striking example is the combination of high temperatures,
      wildfire, and smoke that results in high levels of air pollution across
      broad geographic areas. In recent summers, the western United States has
      been afflicted with multiple episodes; these are projected to become
      increasingly common in the future because of climate change (114).
      Positive feedback loops also occur between heat waves and droughts that
      heighten temperature and desiccation (76, 185). Certain types of
      atmospheric waves can cause multiple simultaneous heat waves distributed
      across the Earth; this may increase the risk of multiple breadbasket
      failures (105). Many of the most impactful heat waves in terms of
      mortality might be better understood as the combination of a number of
      heat extremes occurring in sequence, separated by short cooler breaks—a
      temporally compound heat wave event. The proportion of heat wave hazards
      coming from these temporally compound heat waves is robustly projected to
      increase with global warming (7). Past events highlight the dangers of
      compound extreme events involving TCs or extreme precipitation and related
      flooding. For example, in 2005, Hurricane Katrina led to massive flooding
      in New Orleans (153). Only a few weeks later, Hurricane Rita rebreached
      weakened levees, leading to flooding once again. The nonlinear impacts of
      these events likely exceeded vulnerability thresholds associated with
      protective infrastructures. Significant research remains to understand the
      dynamics of such compound hydrological extremes and to quantify risks to
      populations and communities (144).
