      ✅ Why Rust? Memory safety without a garbage collector: Rust ensures
      memory safety through its ownership model, avoiding common bugs like null
      pointer dereferencing or buffer overflows. High performance: Comparable to
      C/C++, great for system-level programming. Concurrency: Safe concurrency
      features. Growing Ecosystem: Used by companies like Microsoft, Dropbox,
      and Cloudflare. WebAssembly: Rust compiles to WebAssembly efficiently for
      web apps and embedded systems.

      ✅ Why Go? Simplicity and ease of use: Minimalist syntax, very easy to
      learn and read. Great concurrency model: Goroutines make concurrent
      programming simple. Fast compilation and deployment. Built-in tools:
      Formatting, testing, and profiling. Cloud-native and microservices:
      Designed for scalable web apps.
