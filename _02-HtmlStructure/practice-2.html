          Donald Trump has accused Elon Musk of “losing his mind” as the
          dramatic breakdown between America’s most powerful person and the
          world’s richest person escalated into a full-blown feud that could
          have seismic political and economic consequences. In a series of phone
          calls to US media on Friday morning, Trump snapped back at Musk, after
          the tech mogul and Republican financier launched an extraordinary
          social media attack on the president the day before, which ended with
          him accusing Trump of being named in the so-called “Epstein files” –
          documents related to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
          Trump went on his Truth social platform on Friday and posted a
          statement attributed to the Epstein criminal defense attorney David
          Schoen that vehemently denied Musk’s accusation. “I can say
          authoritatively, unequivocally and definitively that [Epstein] had no
          information to hurt President Trump,” Schoen’s statement said. “I
          specifically asked him!” The row between Musk and Trump, who were
          near-constant companions during the later stages of the latter’s
          presidential campaign in 2024 and his first months back in the White
          House, showed no sign of abating, with Musk’s self-proclaimed status
          as “first buddy” rapidly disappearing in the rear-view mirror.

          Maybe they just said, ‘Look, all of these people, these judges, they
          want to try and run the country.’ A local judge trying to run the
          country," said Trump. "The man has a horrible past, and I could see a
          decision being made, bring him back, show everybody how horrible this
          guy is." The president said, "Frankly, we have to do something because
          the judges are trying to take the place of a president that won in a
          landslide. That's not supposed to be the way it is. So, I can see
          bringing him back. I could see. He's a bad guy." The Trump
          administration deported Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old illegal alien who
          was living in Maryland, to a high-security prison in his home country
          back in March on the grounds that he is a member of the violent MS-13
          gang. Soon after his deportation, Democrats jumped to advocate for
          Abrego Garcia’s release and return to the U.S., arguing that he was a
          wrongly deported "Maryland man."
